### Critical Filters to Implement

1. **Bonding Curve Progress** (Most Important)
   - Require: >60% bonded
   - Why: Shows real demand, not just bots
   - Impact: Filters out 80% of instant-death tokens

2. **Volume in First Minute**
   - Require: >$50K volume
   - Why: Real community buying, not wash trading
   - Impact: Filters out bot-created scams

3. **Unique Holder Count**
   - Require: >50 unique buyers
   - Why: Real distribution, not single whale
   - Impact: Filters out rug pull setups

4. **Price Momentum**
   - Require: Positive in first 30 seconds
   - Why: Tokens that start negative usually die
   - Impact: Filters out 64% of fast-die tokens

5. **Creator Wallet History**
   - Require: <10 token launches total
   - Why: Serial launchers = rug factories
   - Impact: Filters out professional scammers

6. **Buyer/Seller Ratio**
   - Require: >70% buyers in first minute
   - Why: More sellers = dump incoming
   - Impact: Filters out pre-coordinated dumps

7. **Smart Money Tracking**

*** DOES 'DUAL RECORDERS' DO THIS? ***

## 🎯 Overview

This feature extends lifecycle tracking to continue monitoring token prices for **120 seconds after exit**, enabling analysis of exit timing quality 
and opportunity cost calculation.

---

## 💡 Problem Solved

**Before:** When a position exited, lifecycle tracking stopped immediately. We had no data on whether we exited too early (token mooned after) or at 
the right time (token crashed after).

**After:** System now tracks price movements for 120 seconds post-exit, recording:
- How much the token moved after we sold
- What our return would have been if we held longer
- Opportunity cost (money left on table vs. good exit)


---
## 🎓 Strategy Optimization Workflow

1. **Collect Data** (Run bot for 24 hours with post-exit tracking)
2. **Analyze Lifecycle Files** (Use `analyze-lifecycle-results.js`)
3. **Calculate Metrics:**
   - Average opportunity cost per exit type (stop loss, tier 1, tier 2, etc.)
   - % of exits that left money on table (opportunityCost > 0)
   - % of exits that saved from bigger losses (opportunityCost < 0)
4. **Optimize Targets:**
   - If avg opportunityCost > +30%: Raise tier targets
   - If avg opportunityCost < -30%: Lower tier targets (exiting too late)
   - If stop losses have positive opportunityCost: Widen stop loss
5. **Iterate** (Re-test with adjusted targets)
