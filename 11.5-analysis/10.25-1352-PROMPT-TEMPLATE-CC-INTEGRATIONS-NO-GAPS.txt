INTEGRATION COMPLETION CHECKLIST


When integrating [NEW_COMPONENT]:

1. INFRASTRUCTURE CHECK:
   - [ ] New component file created
   - [ ] Dependencies installed
   - [ ] Exports added to index files
   - [ ] TypeScript compiles with zero errors

2. INTEGRATION CHECK:
   - [ ] Find ALL code paths that should use new component
   - [ ] Replace OLD implementation with NEW in each path
   - [ ] Remove or deprecate OLD implementation
   - [ ] Verify NO code paths still use OLD method

3. TESTING CHECK:
   - [ ] Run 5-minute test
   - [ ] Verify new component is actually called (add debug logs)
   - [ ] Verify old component is NOT called (grep for old function names)
   - [ ] Check for expected behavior (cache hits, faster response, etc)

4. VERIFICATION CHECK:
   - [ ] Show me the grep results for old function calls
   - [ ] Show me the logs proving new component is used
   - [ ] Show me the performance improvement (before/after)
   - [ ] Confirm ZERO instances of old implementation remain

5. DOCUMENTATION CHECK:
   - [ ] Update README with integration status
   - [ ] Document any code paths that still use old method (if any)
   - [ ] Note any technical debt or future improvements needed

DO NOT mark integration as "complete" unless ALL checkboxes are ✅
DO NOT say "just needs integration" - DO THE INTEGRATION
DO NOT assume - VERIFY with code evidence

Report status for each checkbox with evidence.
